hello world from joeio

4/4 TOM - After collaborating on a list of router views and components my INTENTION was to produce a component heirarchy diagram to aid planning and production.

5/4 TOM - OUTCOME - I generated a component heirarchy for the main 'postfeed' page. Feeling some confusion over router pages and their relationship with components - I did some revision then produced a diagram of router pages for the project which showed their relationships and url assignments. INTENTION - To revise Github, then build the router background elements for the group project. And to build the wait animation (loading) component too.

6/4 TOM - OUTCOME - Got the router pages code done, and familiarised myself with the Github process by building and merging the wait animation component while sharing with Joe who was also building a component. INTENTION - after problems began to emerge on our shared Github project it became evident that several of us were merging from the Main and it had become problematic with node modules. After looking into .gitignore I resolved to rebuild the repository transferring over existing work.

7/4 TOM - OUTCOME - Natalie offered to rebuild the repository instead so I stepped back from that. INTENTION - to map out schemas for our project and revise front/back communication.

8/4 TOM - OUTCOME I collaborated on schemas for User, Post, and Comments. After revising I locally built a backend utilizing these schemas and a frontend to test their interaction with Mongo database. There were problems. INTENTION - to resolve the problems existing in the front/back end code, merge the results into the group repository and begin utilizing this in building components for the project.
